Note (PG): on my laptop, the card appears as /dev/sdc1 (note partition 1, not
the complete raw device).

Not really.

Don't use Windows device names.  You can find the mappings from POSIX
device names to Windows device names here:

  http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-ug-net/using-specialnames.html#pathnames-posixdevices

In your case that would be /dev/sdc.  But that probably won't work.
I don't remember the exact details, but you shoudl rather access
the first partition on the device, rather than the entire device.
like this:

  /dev/sdc1

Yep.

cat /proc/partitions
