Menus are bad for a thrifty i/f. The OSSI for a true praxis will be binary.

TAG
---

Coll: s (lh M m pl span) h q D E F Q

---
s set local_host freq_major freq_minor power_level rx_span

  Zeroes skip parameters, e.g. 's 0 50 0 0 2028' changes sensor reading and
  reporting cycle to 50 seconds, and rx open window to 2048 ms. Some
  params are not independent, e.g. the power_level hex map, or overloaded,
  e.g. rx_span 1 is 'always on'. Half cooked but useful for testing.

  s displays statistics, mostly useless here.

---

h - help (laconic menu)

---

q - quit (reset)

---

D from to status upto

  from, to - eeprom boundary slots (can be descending), status is selective,
  upto restricts output. E.g.

  D 40 20 dumps info from the 40th down to 20th slot
  
  D 0 1000000000 248 11 dumps first 11 entries with SENS_COLLECTED status.
  Note that there are 200 ms delays on each iteration, so be careful.

  Statuses: 
  0 - all,
  240 - SENS_CONFIRMED,
  248 - SENS_COLLECTED,
  252 - SENS_IN_USE

  I know. But, this wasn't meant to be on the i/f, and is temporary.

---

E - erase eeprom and reset

---

F - erase flash (FIM) and reset

---

Q - erase eeprom, flash, and reset

---

The last three are useful for nodes after fatal error runs (e.g. after
their eeproms are overflown.

In regular operations, Q should be on the 'long reset' button.

==========================

PEG
---

Agg: s (lh mid pl) m f g t r h q T D E F Q

s local_host, master_id, power_level [0-7] (set)

m [tag] sends mag_master to <tag>, on top of the regular (ca. 30s) broadcast.
  Mostly useless, unless master change is needed.

f tag peg (find <tag> at <peg>)
  Brings the latest entry about the <tag> from the <peg>. Tag 0 counts tags
  on the <peg>.

g tag peg (get tag through peg)
  The request goes to the Peg, waits there until rx window on the Tag opens,
  gets sent to the Tag, and the response comes back, through the Tag again.
  Cool but mostly useless.

t tag peg (set tag through peg)
  Same mechanism as in 'g', sort of remote 's maj min pl span' on the Tag.
  Be careful.

r peg local_host power_level string
  Sets these attributes on the remote Peg. Rather useless, other than to
  demontrate 2 way communication (e.g. 'string' is displayed on the Peg).

D from to tag upto
  Similar to D in Tag, but 'tag' replaced 'status'.
  Note that while selection by 'status' makes sense on Tags and doesn't on Pegs,
  selection by 'tag' works on Pegs, and doesn't on Tags.

h, q, E, F, Q same as in Tags.

T time
  Allowed only on the Master. 'time' is meant to be a reference time from OSS,
  e.g. the EPOCH timestamp. Master time (and this reference) is propagated to
  Pegs in periodic msg_master messages, and forwarded to Tags as part of the
  acks for sensor readings. This way, all reports with sensor readings are
  normalized to this OSS-set time.
