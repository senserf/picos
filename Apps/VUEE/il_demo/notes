Base & ref. point: eco_demo. It was touched as lightly as possible; e.g.
we carry 6-sensor array until we know what's truly needed - we can get away
with it on WARSAW_ILS, as read_sensor() doesn't barf for unknown ones. As soon
as we have the hardware, we'll correct the sensors, and follow with VUEE. Also,
options.sys will be 'modernized' and split for agg., and 2 flavours of colls,
as soon as we can configure and test the hardware.

- removed _cus;
- removed satellite stuff;
- new vuee style (with app_peg_data.h);
- added OPRE_APP_REP_GONE and changed OPRE_APP_REP: the 'gone' tag reporting
  come with OPRE_APP_REP_GONE (1014) prefix;
- rep_str in str_peg.h: no slots for agg & col,
  tag's rssi (at reporting peg) and master's seconds() added at eol;
- for hierarchy, the easiest were pools of up to 9 coll. per agg, e.g. il.xml:
    agg. 1: master in a separate room, no colls
    agg. 1010: room 101 with colls 1011 1012 1013
    agg. 1020: room 102 with colls 1021 1022 1023
    agg. 1030: room 103 with colls 1031 1032, but also next room with 1033 1034;
- left double tstamps for now: no harm, no sense;
- TARP seems screwed up: on the praxis side, hco was not inited; on the LibComms
    side, optimal routes were rejected if slack was 0. Patched in tarp.c.
    We need tarp auto-tests, eco_demo should be adjusted and tested, even if
    routing is off there (i.e. no immediate damage).
    tarp_trace.zip contains uart output and tarp trace of a run of il.xml
    model. Some comments in the dbg_tarptrace.txt within, in case we embark on
    routing improvements. tarp_trace.zip should be deleted soon.

LEDS:
- T&P: R ON - fatal error; + B BLINK - caused by eeprom
- T&P startup: R BLLINK (maint.), G BLINK
- T&P normal: all off
- Tags: all retries fail - B BLINK
- Pegs: no msg from the master for 3x audit freq. - B BLINK

- T&P: B ON reserved for low battery level?

Thoughts

ODR (Operator Directed Routing), with flavours {strict, boost}. Boost is just
to direct packet outging from the sink, to appropriate direction.

TARP testbed & test automation: a must. Perhaps in VUEE?
