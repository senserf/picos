If you have used the very first old version of econnect (one that didn't
have to be installed), and you have this folder:

	C:\econnect

on your system, remove that folder before the installation.

If you have an installed version of econnect already (the list of installed
programs in the Control Panel shows EConnect), unistall it first.

Then, click at the econnect.msi file to install this new version.
