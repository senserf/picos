Warsaw board, power consumption
===============================

Vcc = 3.1V

Each value taken over a 24 second period


Note:

Xmitter running means sending a 48-byte packet every 128 (PicOS) milliseconds.

cap means 100uF capacitor across Vcc (my idea to smooth out rapid current
variations to reduce the impact of AC component)

-usb means USB/UART disconnected. There seems to be residual back current from the
UART to Vcc.

-jtag means JTag disconnected (it seems to drain some current, which is visible at
lower ranges).

==================================================================================

The device isn't very good at measuring current varying from very low (below 500uA
over 20mA). It has a "low" range (for current below 20mA) and medium range (below
1A), but the medium range gives wrong (too high) results with freeze. Consequently,
I couldn't really measure alternating freeze and, say, transmission, very precisely.

But this shouldn't matter. Suppose, for example, that every 15 minutes we wake up,
run the ADC for 1 sec, CPU for 1 sec, transmit for 1 sec, and listen for 2 sec.
We get: (885*50uA + 1*1.5mA + 1*20mA + 2*22mA)/900 = 122uA. Make it 150uA. This
gives us ca. 400 days on a 1Ah battery. Is this estimation sound?

XMit appears to be using slightly less power than receive because transmission
was not continuous. The numbers in parantheses are power (0-7) and rate.
