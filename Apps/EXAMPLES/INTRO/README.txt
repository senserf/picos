Some of these examples are discussed in the PicOS document (Programming under PicOS,
PICOS/Docs/PicOS.pdf), section 2.1 (HELLO_WORLD, OUTPUT) and section 2.8 (LEDS).
A slightly more refined version of HELLO_WORLD is also featured in the PIP
document (PIP: an Integrated SDK for PicOS, PIP/DOC/PIP.pdf), section 4, to be
developed by the reader (student) as an exercise.
