R050722A:

	Short checksums, encryption, cleaned PHYSOPT's, added PHYSOPT_SESID
	(both in CHIPCON as well as DM2100); station Id is now inserted by
	the transmitter; access to loose pins, including ADC on GP0-GP7 (in
	fact, GP0 is not usable as it is reserved for RSSI).

	phys_dm2100 (...) accepts only two arguments (the SId argument has
	been removed).

	The SId is now automatically inserted by the transmitter (its role
	is to act as the network Id, so it makes sense), but only if it is
	nonzero. Note that you can send a packet without touching the SId
	field by setting the station's SId to zero (PHYSOPT_SESID).

	New functions available from the dm2100 driver
	(see Libs/Lib/phys_DM2100.h):

	pin_get (pn). pn is the pin number (1 - 11, corresponding to GP1-7
	and then CFG0-CFG3 (8-11). Number zero corresponds to GP0, but GP0
	is illegal because it is reserved for RSSI. The function returns the
	value (0/1) of the respective pin.

	pin_set (pn, val) sets or clears the indicated pin (1-11), depending
	on whether val is zero or nonzero.

	pin_get_adc (pin, ref, stime) returns the ADC-converted voltage on the
	indicated pin (1-7 - only P6 pins can be used for this). If ref is
	zero, the reference voltage is 1.5V, otherwise it is 2.5V. stime gives
	(roughly) the sampling time in milliseconds (64 is the max, 0 == 4
	msec should be OK for signals that don't have to be integrated).

	Note that the receiver should be stopped before calling pin_get_adc,
	as the ADC converter is used by the receiver. If the function is
	called while the receiver is active, it returns -1 and does nothing.

	The direction of a pin is input by default. Upon the first call to
	pin_set, the pin becomes output and cannot be used for input any
	more.
	
R050730A:

	Function pin_wait (word pin, word state) for dm2100. pin is between 
	8 and 11 inclusively and corresponds to CFG0-CFG3. It declares a wait
	for the specified pin to go up. The pin value must be checked after
	the event is triggered to make sure that the pin value is in fact
	high. Note: there is no trigger for the pin going down, so this state
	must be polled by the application.

R050730B:

	Fixed pin_wait to operate on CFG1 and CFG2. The value of pin should be
	1 or 2.
