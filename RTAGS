PG111027A:

	Started RTAGS. Previous modifications were crudely described at the
	respective commits.

	PIP is slowly approaching a shape making it almost presentable. Here is
	the list of things that work:

	- Opening projects, handling files, adding files to projects, deleting
	  files, directories, and so on. The file handling part is practically
	  complete together with the reasonably powerfull, flexible, and
	  friendly tree viewer in the left pane of the project window.

	- Editing files. Maybe to say that elvis has been integrated with PIP
	  would be an overstatement, but it has been made to collaborate. Some
	  work remains to be done (e.g., ctags can be improved), but it is
	  quite OK already. In particular:

	  - Files are opened for editing by clicking on them, including
	    clicks in the terminal pane. Clicking on an error location produced
	    by the compiler (including picomp) opens the file at the requisite
	    position.

	  - Tagging basically works. When you click on an object in an elvis
	    window, PIP will locate the file with the object's definition and
	    try to open that file at the perinent location. Some tags still
	    don't work, but its is pretty much clear how to fix the problems
	    (so we will take care of the details after some more desperately
	    needed things have been made to work).

	  - PIP knows which files have been modified and not saved, so it can
	    notify the user and even force a file to be saved before a build.

	- Simple (skeletal) builds. PIP invokes mkmk, make, and picomp to
	  compile things.

	I am going to work next on VUEE, i.e., some integration of picomp and
	udaemon with PIP.

PG111029A:

	VUEE is now "integrated". this is the first "presentable" version
	including installation scripts for elvis and PIP. Many cleanups and
	two or three bugs fixed. Previously, the running status of a term
	action wasn't recognized properly (in particular when PIP thought it
	had killed the process, it wasn't always true). That should be OK now.

PG111030A:

	Changed the kill signal for pipe processes from QUIT to INT. QUIT would
	cause unnecessary core/stack dumps. Also the kill operation now handles
	pipes with multiple (more than 2) stages in a (hopefully) foolproof
	manner.

	A few cosmetics in README.txt.

PG111106A:

	Integrated the Elprotronic loader (sort of). Improved the handling of
	elvis commands (piped to elvis windows) by delaying them for a while
	until the window has started.

PG111107A:

	Integrated genimage.
