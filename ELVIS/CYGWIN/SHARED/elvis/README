This directory contains the standard versions of elvis' configuration
files.  DO NOT MODIFY THESE FILES!  To perform host-specific customization,
copy files from this directory into /etc/elvis/, and then modify the copies.
To make user-specific changes, create a ~/.elvis/ directory (if it doesn't
exist already) and copy files from this directory into ~/.elvis/ and then
modify the copies.  Any file that elvis finds in ~/.elvis/ or /etc/elvis/
overrides the similarly named file in this directory.
