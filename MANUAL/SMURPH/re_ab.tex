\begin{abstract}

Local area networks and other systems with the perceived
functionality of closely coupled distributed computing
architectures are characterized by very specific protocol design issues.
Unlike in the case of high protocol layers, the design of a low-level
protocol must take into account several physical phenomena which are
irrelevant at a higher level.
The correct interpretation of these phenomena is critical to ensure
both the protocol's agreement with its specification and the efficient
utilization of the channel bandwidth.
We introduce \smurph---an object oriented simulator for investigating
physical
communication systems at the medium access control level.
\smurph\ can be viewed as a combination of a protocol specification
system with an emulated environment for executing the protocol specifications.
This environment is realistic in the sense that it reflects all the relevant
communication phenomena occurring in real physical channels.
\smurph\ can be used to aid the protocol design process: the designer
can evaluate
the protocol performance and test the protocol for correctness without
resorting to an actual implementation.
