This is another version of H-Net (see directory 'H-Net1'). In this version,
each station has one packet buffer and only one transmitter. Based on the
packet's detsination, the transmitter decides on which bus the packet is
to be transmitted.
To create a simulator instance, execute 'mks' in this directory.
