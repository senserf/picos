// This is a file-server type traffic in which one selected station behaves as
// a server and the remaining stations are clients issuing page transfer
// requests to the server. This traffic can be viewed as a variant of RPC with
// only one server separated from the clients. The requests are divided into
// reads and writes (the percentage of writes is read from the input data
// file). The size of a read request packet is fixed and equal to the size of
// the confirmation packet that arrives in response to a write request.
// Similarly, the size of a page is also fixed. One read request results in
// exactly one page being transmitted from the server to the client. One
// write request involves one page being transmitted to the server.
