// This is an RPC-type traffic in which every station behaves as a server and
// a client (customer) at the same time. Every now and then a customer
// generates a request message addressed to a given server (selected at
// random) which is always different from the customer station. The request
// generator at the sender is suspended until a replay to the last request
// arrives. Reply messages have priority over requests, i.e., if a station
// has a reply message queued, the packets of this message will be selected
// (acquired for transmission) before any possible request packets available
// at the same time. We collect service time statistics individually for
// each station.
