WO100715A:

  new_il_demo:
  
  - Changed stats format: all PHYSOPT_ERROR and memfree counters, instead of
    host_id we see derived and current local_host. See new_id_demo/notes.
  - Changed stats msgs to accomodate the above. Reflash all nodes in the net.
  - All nodes go powerdown() in _APP_EXPERIMENT (used to be just odd ids).
  - Default (in options.sys) RADIO_CRC_MODE is 4 (soft crc).
  - No calls to empty (but defined in the board def.) read_sensor(). Including
    power meter on aggregators. No output format change for sensor data.

WO100727A:	VUEE >= WO100727A

  TARP retries. See new_il_demo for mandatory tarp routines and options.sys.

WO100728A:

 new_il_demo, options.sys:
  - retries:
      TARP_RTR N (number of retries (on 1s interval). 1 or 2.
      TCV_TIMERS, TCV_HOOKS 1 (_TARP_T_RTR 1 for debugging RTRs
  - PURE_FORWARDERS 1 will make all nodes with ids below 100 pure forwarders -
      they will be ignoring collector data.

  Moved annoying 'Unconfirmed ...' from INFO to DEBUG level. Note that tag's
  'Not confirmed' stays - it is more important and should be rarer.

  Added mhop.xml model for in-line multi-hopping.

  All aggregators (with master_host set) send to it status report every
  tag_auditFreq * 2^POW_FREQ_SHIFT seconds. Default: 23 * 64 ~= 25 minutes.

 Minor adjustments in tarp.c, no early killing of retried packets
 (commented out).

 Retries:
   Imperfect as they are, they seem to improve routing is some topologies
   a lot. More studies needed. Try new_il_demo with the mhop.xml model.

   Nest iteration: only packets with higher hoc (down the stream) should
   clear retries. As it is now, a retry upstream will clear retries, which
   is both common and unwanted. Thus, hoc must be added to the rtr cache.

   It seems that with the link retries, PURE_FORWARDERS should be used.
   Without, PURE_FORWARDERS have ambiguous impact: less msgs, but also
   diminished redundancy in source data gathering.

WO100729A
  Traces in new_il_demo:
    Command: t node_id [dir hop_limit]
      node_id is the target, bcast allowed, but not recommended
      dir: 0 (default): backward, 1: forward, 2: bidir
      hop_limit: killed after so many hops

    OSS should be careful, no input checks for now.

    Trace output via diags, for now (this is a debug tool anyway):
        tr 104 [0]
	    trace(104) 18 3 3:
	    trel 104 107
	    trel 3 99
	    trel 2 107

	    18 - backward (this is a msg type)
	    3 hops each way (not always equal)
	    trace element (trel) 104 - node_id, 107 - rssi

	tr 104 1
	    trace(104) 16 3 3:
	    trel 2 108
	    trel 103 97
	    trel 104 108

	tr 104 2
	    trace(104) 14 3 2:
	    trel 2 107
	    trel 3 106
	    trel 104 97
	    trel 3 98

    Ligtly tested under VUEE - be careful.

WO100801A:
  new_il_demo:
  - retry caches resist retries from upstream (better behaviour at least in
		  the in-line topology)
  - closing {local_host, rssi} reported in trace outputs.

WO110213A:
  Added CHRONOS to new_il_demo, see -110213- in 'notes' there. Major update.

WO110423A:
  mm_demo: instrumented for BT (Seatan), see mm.odt
  new_il_demo: preserved a simple BT / UART switch driven by BOARD_WARSAW_BLUE

WO110827A:
  Added kek_ned, see 'notes there. Updated Olsonet's (c) in main.c.

WO111127A:
  Updated 'survey', see survey.odt for functional changes. This, plus restored
  ee_open() and some cosmetics. Also, nov21.xml describes outdoor experiments
  comparing emspcc with Nanotron nodes.

WO111217A:
  Updated mm_demo: mostly format changes for ANDROIDEMO (set in options.sys).
  However, PEG_STR_LEN change from 15 to 33 bloats ram and nvm structs.
  Also, the alarms are used for handshakes with encoded meanings: in VUEE,
  odd nodes respond 'no', even ones 'yes', with auto-generated 'ack-alarms'.
  For demos only, in hybrid scenarios with VUEE and real hardware.

WO120226A:
  Added PROPRIETARY/vsen_demo as a (failed) attempt to unify different
  sensors. Some good was produced, see Pawel's commits. vsen will go to
  NL for lightly defined demos.

  survey: set defaults to 'no all out', mainly for UfO.

  Created PROPRIETARY/inProgress, for stuff with such status - I'm tired
  of maintaining local git branches with half-cooked and demo stuff.
  I put Ariadne, ams_demo and ert there.

  tarp: a plugin signature adjustment.

WO120301A:
  For empty sockets, SHT returns -1 -1 on 10SHT and 0 0 on ARTURO* boards,
  but we don't want to normalize this now (besides, these drivers *should* be
  independent). Changed snippets within piter_plug.tcl and econnect.tcl
  to output -1C and -1% on these boards. Note that a regexp had to be
  adjusted in piter_plug.tcl, to let '-' in -1 values through.
  Pawel should review these patches, trivial as they are.

WO120302A:
  Minute change in mm_demo, to let through to OSS msgs (profi and alrm) even
  if p_inc ('include'preferences) don't match). OSS (presumably, an Android app)
  would rate the incoming info and sort or drop it based on user's preferences.

WO120320B:
  Added Chronos to vsen_demo, updated econnect. vsen.xml says it all - it is
  a tentative setup for demos in NL. 'B' because it is after Pawel's PG120320A.

WO120419A:
  vsen_demo: added WARSAW_SONAR (as simps), updated CHRONOS with the driver
  changes. See vsen_demo/notes tail for a short summary. This version will
  update Raoul's inventory.

WO120512A:
  mm_demo updates for Android most recent works. mm_odt clearly shows the
  original and the two updates. Still, some (relatively old) functionality is
  undocumented, but an up-to-date version should wait for consistent 
  requirements and total rewrite, which are due after 1st demo / user feedback.

  In vsen_demo, options.sys shows (commented out) European settings and moves
  RF to channel 255. 'Ronin buzzer' is added. Chronos def. freq. is changed
  from 30 to 60, other nodes' from 30 to 900. All the changes were used for
  experiments with CMA and dimihished RTLS.

WO120820A:
  - inProgress/trace: Read trace.odt there. Unfinished business: Soon, we'll
    update it after DIVA slides, for DIVA and similar demos. After that, open
    problems, sensor module and OSS refinements are expected.
  - In tarp.c, trace-related castings are fixed.
  - In il_demo, sensor- and board-related symbols are updated. More updates
    and cleanup will come after board_options are streamlined and made
    available for VUEE.
  - In mm_demo, STACK_SIZE is updated 256->512.

WO121020A:
  - PROPRIETARY/tracEd, see tracEd.odt there. Significant update of what 
    used to be inProgress/trace, which is removed. To be continue.
  - Cosmetics in mm_demo:
    - TARP params changed 0xB1 -> 0xA3, for better routing in Paul's exp's.
    - HID / host_id changes to follow PicOS.

WO121103A:
  TracEd: updates after the WiSense presentation & talks with Pawel:
  - Chronos buzzes in UIoff mode
  - highlight colors
  - updated .odt, removed some code comments

WO121209A:
  inProgress/netting: Another praxis meant as blueprint, this time for
  experiments with networking. Disappointments include incombatibility with
  tracEd meant to traliblaze general OSSI structures. So, this part of
  tracEd was futile; perhaps BOSS? As to 'netting', see netting.odt in there.

WO121217A:
  - eco_demo: 
  -- For WARSAW_ILS, first four sensors show int. temp. (-2),
     int. voltage (-1), light (0), movements (1); other boards unchanged.
     My understanding is that OSS scripts running on comip.ca use sensor slots
     0, 1, so for WARSAW_ILS they'll have voltage and light, as needed for
     solar panel experiments.
  -- Power sensor on pegs corrected to -1.
  -- .xml models updated for current sensor indexing.
  -- Adjusted various options* for current VUEE status and comip.ca channel.
     BE CAREFUL to avoid interference with the live run.

 - preserved inProgress/netting in inProgress/alphat, as it was sent to
   Alphatronics. The latest Netting.odt is both in netting and alphat.

 - TESTS/RFTEST updated for current host_id PicOS status.

WO121226A:
 - cosmetic cleanup in tarp.c debug facilities
 - inProgress/netting:
 -- lword ref# everywhere, including trace
 -- ack (2-way route) is optional on odr
 -- optional odr output on transient nodes
 -- WARSAW_BLUE goes via UART 2 (not tested)
 -- updated Netting.odt

WO121228A:
TARP header changed, with hoc, hco :4 and separate weak, prox flags. Lightly
tested, but the changes are rather trivial. The new prox flag is used in
netting, significantly improving ODR with non-zero TARP's slack. Note that
other applications that use proximity messages are unchanged; there, the
similar functionality can be achieved by switching on TARP's fwd flag.

It seems that my abhorrence to bit-fields came from experience with the eCog
compiler... if so, TARP caches should be redesigned as well. However, that
should wait for some form of TARP test bed. Either we'll try something within
SIDE, as we discussed with Pawel, or we'll reheat old tries from TARP's early
days.

WO130224A:
Location-related (partial) works.
Ariadne 
- allow TARP_RTR, even if not immediately needed.
- adapt a flavour of combat10.xml, common for experiments and simulations.
- surloc.tcl - location-related (temporary) script.
Netting 
- If compiled with ODR_FILL_BCAST (by default present in options.sys), at
  'broadcast steps' in ODR nodes fill in their ids. It helps with RSSI
  recording, but also makes the ODR strict when retracting to the source;
  hence under the option.
- 'f' command formats OSS out. If set, the ODR output is suitable for
  SIMPLE experiments, where the server uses the string to set return path.
  Defaults to 0, not written to FIM. It replaces compile-time
  ODR_MHOP_SERV_EXPER, which is eliminated.
- options.sys cleaned up a bit.
- Added exp subdir, location-related, see Expernetting.odt there.
- rssi.tcl and loca.tcl - location-related (temporary) scripts.

WO130312A:
Still unfinished location-related works. I'd like to commit the status quo
before switching to the new CC1100 driver:

- in inProgress/netting:
-- loca.tcl produce 4 files: db and queries with rssi forward anc backward.
-- 2loca.tcl: an attempt to process files generatedfrom surveys (tags) and
   "proxy auto-profiling". The former is a 1-hop bcast ODR, the latter either
   2-hop bcast on bcast or several anchored bcasts. 8 files are produced.
-- combReal.xml - mirror/model of what hangs at the HQ.
-- combReal directory contains data gathered from the HQ setup, with
   several 1-hop and 2-hop surveys. Note that this is NOT the data we want to
   produce in true surveys; old driver was used, only 2 tag points.

- in LOCATION (and ./TEST):
-- locdbase.c and query.c got the infamous #define _GNU_SOURCE.
-- in params.xml, I added <slr> transforms that "work" for vuee and real
   setup at the HQ. (They'recommented out.)

WO130327A:
Location-related updates, in netting and (minimal) in LOCATION/TEST.
ExperiNetting.odt is a must if you want to continue on this thread. Changes:
- combReal directory with combReal13* is zipped in combReal1303.zip. In the
  results, the 150 node is corrected (I cheated, collecting data from 150's
  location from the 77 node).
- exp dir is cleaned and ready for experimenting descibed in experiNetting.
- 2loca.tcl and verloca.tcl create and verify location-related data
- combReal.xml uses combReal_ch.xml (instead of channel.xml)
- _coord lists coordiantes for combReal stuff
- oo_samples.txt contains samples generated from real runs. It is here for
  the convenience of running VUEE without the data re-generation.

- In LOCATION/TEST: query.c modified to provide querying id,
	params.xml contains a few <slr> (this mess is temporary here, as it
	should be by praxis / model)

WO130415A:
In netting, updated _coord, combReal.xml, added hq.gif for the engine and model.
In LOCATION/TEST, updated params.xml with exp. SLR translation.
In phys_cc1100.c, replaced overflowing RADIO_DEFAULT_BITRATE with
  RADIO_BITRATE_INDEX for startup reporting.
