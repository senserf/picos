WO100715A:

  new_il_demo:
  
  - Changed stats format: all PHYSOPT_ERROR and memfree counters, instead of
    host_id we see derived and current local_host. See new_id_demo/notes.
  - Changed stats msgs to accomodate the above. Reflash all nodes in the net.
  - All nodes go powerdown() in _APP_EXPERIMENT (used to be just odd ids).
  - Default (in options.sys) RADIO_CRC_MODE is 4 (soft crc).
  - No calls to empty (but defined in the board def.) read_sensor(). Including
    power meter on aggregators. No output format change for sensor data.

WO100727A:	VUEE >= WO100727A

  TARP retries. See new_il_demo for mandatory tarp routines and options.sys.

WO100728A:

 new_il_demo, options.sys:
  - retries:
      TARP_RTR N (number of retries (on 1s interval). 1 or 2.
      TCV_TIMERS, TCV_HOOKS 1 (_TARP_T_RTR 1 for debugging RTRs
  - PURE_FORWARDERS 1 will make all nodes with ids below 100 pure forwarders -
      they will be ignoring collector data.

  Moved annoying 'Unconfirmed ...' from INFO to DEBUG level. Note that tag's
  'Not confirmed' stays - it is more important and should be rarer.

  Added mhop.xml model for in-line multi-hopping.

  All aggregators (with master_host set) send to it status report every
  tag_auditFreq * 2^POW_FREQ_SHIFT seconds. Default: 23 * 64 ~= 25 minutes.

 Minor adjustments in tarp.c, no early killing of retried packets
 (commented out).

 Retries:
   Imperfect as they are, they seem to improve routing is some topologies
   a lot. More studies needed. Try new_il_demo with the mhop.xml model.

   Nest iteration: only packets with higher hoc (down the stream) should
   clear retries. As it is now, a retry upstream will clear retries, which
   is both common and unwanted. Thus, hoc must be added to the rtr cache.

   It seems that with the link retries, PURE_FORWARDERS should be used.
   Without, PURE_FORWARDERS have ambiguous impact: less msgs, but also
   diminished redundancy in source data gathering.

WO100729A
  Traces in new_il_demo:
    Command: t node_id [dir hop_limit]
      node_id is the target, bcast allowed, but not recommended
      dir: 0 (default): backward, 1: forward, 2: bidir
      hop_limit: killed after so many hops

    OSS should be careful, no input checks for now.

    Trace output via diags, for now (this is a debug tool anyway):
        tr 104 [0]
	    trace(104) 18 3 3:
	    trel 104 107
	    trel 3 99
	    trel 2 107

	    18 - backward (this is a msg type)
	    3 hops each way (not always equal)
	    trace element (trel) 104 - node_id, 107 - rssi

	tr 104 1
	    trace(104) 16 3 3:
	    trel 2 108
	    trel 103 97
	    trel 104 108

	tr 104 2
	    trace(104) 14 3 2:
	    trel 2 107
	    trel 3 106
	    trel 104 97
	    trel 3 98

    Ligtly tested under VUEE - be careful.

WO100801A:
  new_il_demo:
  - retry caches resist retries from upstream (better behaviour at least in
		  the in-line topology)
  - closing {local_host, rssi} reported in trace outputs.

WO110213A:
  Added CHRONOS to new_il_demo, see -110213- in 'notes' there. Major update.

WO110423A:
  mm_demo: instrumented for BT (Seatan), see mm.odt
  new_il_demo: preserved a simple BT / UART switch driven by BOARD_WARSAW_BLUE

WO110827A:
  Added kek_ned, see 'notes there. Updated Olsonet's (c) in main.c.

WO111127A:
  Updated 'survey', see survey.odt for functional changes. This, plus restored
  ee_open() and some cosmetics. Also, nov21.xml describes outdoor experiments
  comparing emspcc with Nanotron nodes.

WO111217A:
  Updated mm_demo: mostly format changes for ANDROIDEMO (set in options.sys).
  However, PEG_STR_LEN change from 15 to 33 bloats ram and nvm structs.
  Also, the alarms are used for handshakes with encoded meanings: in VUEE,
  odd nodes respond 'no', even ones 'yes', with auto-generated 'ack-alarms'.
  For demos only, in hybrid scenarios with VUEE and real hardware.

WO120226A:
  Added PROPRIETARY/vsen_demo as a (failed) attempt to unify different
  sensors. Some good was produced, see Pawel's commits. vsen will go to
  NL for lightly defined demos.

  survey: set defaults to 'no all out', mainly for UfO.

  Created PROPRIETARY/inProgress, for stuff with such status - I'm tired
  of maintaining local git branches with half-cooked and demo stuff.
  I put Ariadne, ams_demo and ert there.

  tarp: a plugin signature adjustment.
