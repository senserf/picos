WO100715A:

  new_il_demo:
  
  - Changed stats format: all PHYSOPT_ERROR and memfree counters, instead of
    host_id we see derived and current local_host. See new_id_demo/notes.
  - Changed stats msgs to accomodate the above. Reflash all nodes in the net.
  - All nodes go powerdown() in _APP_EXPERIMENT (used to be just odd ids).
  - Default (in options.sys) RADIO_CRC_MODE is 4 (soft crc).
  - No calls to empty (but defined in the board def.) read_sensor(). Including
    power meter on aggregators. No output format change for sensor data.

WO100727A:	VUEE >= WO100727A

  TARP retries. See new_il_demo for mandatory tarp routines and options.sys.
