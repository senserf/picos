<title> SIDE Tanks experiment </title>

<p>
This experiment consists of a row of interconnected water tanks.
You will see this setup when you click "Connect" on the applet panel
(directory Panel).

<p>
Each tank is equipped with a sensor indicating the water level.
Two neighboring tanks are connected with a pipe and a bidirectional
pump.
We assume that the tanks are filled (and possibly emptied) from the
outside.
The role of the control program in SIDE
is to maintain about the same level of water in all tanks.

You can pull the water level in a tank with your mouse and see how the
system responds to this change.</font>

<h2>Stations</h2>

<p>
The primary action agents in our simple setup are pumps; therefore,
it seems natural to represent each pump as a separate station.
Such a station can be declared as follows:

<br><br>

<br>
</center>

<br>

<p>
When a <tt>Pump</tt> is created, its setup method (the constructor) receives
three network addresses:
two of them describe two sensors (indicating the water level in the
tanks connected by the pump), and one identifies the pump's motor actuator.
The setup method is responsible for creating those objects, in the
following way:

<br><br>

<br>
</center>

<br>

<p>
The arguments of the <tt>create</tt> operation are passed
to the setup method of the created object.
The (virtual) sensors and the actuator will be mapped into their
physical counterparts by the network map layer of the program.

<h2>Processes</h2>

<p>
Each pump station is controlled by a single process whose responsibility
is to monitor the water level in the neighboring tanks and start the pump
whenever there is a difference.
This process is declared as follows:

<br><br>

<center>

<br>
</center>

<br>

<p>
The first line of the above declaration indicates that <tt>PumpDriver</tt>
is a basic process type (i.e., it descends directly from the built-in
type <tt>Process</tt>) and that processes of this type will run at stations
belonging to type <tt>Pump</tt> (including its possible subtypes).
The setup method creates local copies of the pointers to the attributes
of the owning station--for convenient reference from the process.
The process has two states and it runs the following code method:

<br><br>

<br>
</center>

<br>

<p>
Having started in state <tt>WaitStatusChange</tt>, <tt>PumpDriver</tt> issues
two wait requests, one to each of the two sensor mailboxes.
The process wants to get to its second state, <tt>StatusChange</tt>, as soon
as the value of any of the two sensors changes.
This corresponds to a change in the water level in any of the two tanks
connected by the pipe (and pump) managed by the process.
When a change is detected, <tt>PumpDriver</tt> compares the indications
of the two sensors.
If there is less water in the left tank, the pump motor is started in the
left direction.
Otherwise, if the right tank contains less water, the pump is
started in the opposite direction.
Finally, if the two levels are the same, the pump is switched off.
At the end of this action, the process unconditionally transits to
its initial state.

<p>
Note that storing the same value in the motor actuator several times
is harmless, although redundant.
The code method of <tt>PumpDriver</tt> could be easily "optimized" by
remembering the previous status of the actuator and setting it to the
new value only if that value has in fact changed.
The gain would be negligible, however.
Besides, the persistent behavior of the process may be advantageous
from the viewpoint of reliability.
