The examples contained in this directory are described in my book.
Look into OldExamples for a few simple examples that come with their own
short description.

The names of some files may have changed compared to those mentioned in
the book. First, they have been abbreviated to comfort the lowest-common-
denominator file system (i.e., MS-DOS -- blame them, not me for this
feature). Second, SMURPH (SIDE) and C++ files have now the suffix ".cc"
instead of ".c". Some C++ compilers need ".cc" to recognize a file as a
C++ file. Hopefully, you can easily match the names as they appear in the
book with the actual names.

Note that RADIO examples (models) are stored in a separate directory external
to the package. Most of them are proprietary.

Directory Errata contains errors and mistakes that I found in my book.
Note that they don't fix the naming problems mentioned above.
