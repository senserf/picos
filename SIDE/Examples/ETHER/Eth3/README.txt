This is yet another Ethernet implementation which uses files from the include
library. You may want to have a look at the files in InludeLibrary which are
included by 'protocol.cc' and 'root.cc' -- to see how the various pieces from
Ethernet2 have been turned into library include files.
To create a simulator instance, just execute 'mks' in this directory.
