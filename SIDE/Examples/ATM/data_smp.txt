This is a sample data set

Experimenter time unit:                  1000000000.0
**
** Corresponds to one second, assuming that the ITU is equal to
** one nanosecond
**

Clock tolerance:                          0.0001

Grid side length:                         4 nodes
**
** The number of switches == 4x4, the number of end nodes == 4+4+4+4
**

Link length (the same for all links):     50000 nanoseconds
**
** Assuming c == 200,000 km/sec, this is equal to about 10 km
**

Transmission rate (same for all ports):   2
**
** Corresponds to 500,000,000 bits per second, i.e., one bit insertion
** time == 2 ITUs (nanoseconds)
**

Connection timeout (same for all nodes):  0.005 seconds

Bandwidth per switch port (same for all): 10 units
**
** Note: these are just abstract units, each connection takes some of them
**

Buffer capacity (same for all ports):      256 cells
**
** This is the capacity of an output buffer associated with one output port
**

File transfer interarrival time:       0.06 sec/station
Mean file length:                      500000 bits
Bandwith:                              5 units
Acknowledgement timeout:               0.04 seconds
Mean backoff time after a failure:     0.02 seconds

Video source:                          0
Video destination:                     8
Start time (in seconds):               0.1 sec
First frame length (in bits):          200000
Minimum frame length:                  10000
Maximum frame length:                  60000
Frame spacing:                         0.0333333333 seconds
Bandwidth:                             1
Number of frames                       1800
