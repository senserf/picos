\section{Summary}

We have presented a software package for specifying low-level
communication protocols in
a realistic executable environment.
The package, \smurph, has descended from an earlier product, designed
and implemented by the present authors, called \lansf.
In the three years since \lansf\ was created, it has proven to be
more flexible than planned.
It has found applications in investigating a much wider class 
of physical systems than MAC-level protocols for local area networks.

The success of \lansf\ seems to be due to its ability to model physical
events in communication media at an arbitrarily low level.
We believe that the new version of the system will prove more
useful and user friendly than its predecessor.
