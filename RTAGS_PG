R060329B:  Interfrence thresholds: INTLOW/INTHIGH added for Transceivers.

R060430A:  Lots of changes. Now we have something close to a decent version.
           DSD tested with the new templates. So far, so good. Manual updated.

R060430B:  Final fix of a few irrelevancies in REALTIME examples.

R060709A:  Radio example redone and cleaned up a bit.

R060803A:  Changed zz_wait to wait in all AIs, such that it is now legal to
           invoke wait from methods (not only directly from the process code)
           TheSignal and TheSender switched to be compatible with TheItem and
           TheMailbox for mailboxes.
           Barrier mailboxes introduced. The mailbox AI is getting messy a bit,
           so I had to significantly redo the corresponding sections from the
           manual to improve their legibility.
           TheBarrier points to Info01 (as an int).

R060806A:  Symbols __SIDE__ and __SMUPRH__ are now defined for every program
           compiled and set to the version number (a string).
	   Added pfmPDE/pfmMDE to detect packet/message deallocation.
	   Destructing link activities made subtler to account for the fact that
	   some activities are jams and, as such, should not have their "packet"
	   destructors invoked upon deallocation.

R060809A:  Introduced a variant of sleep (automatically selected by smpp) to be
	   used in functions called from processes. This one uses longjmp
	   instead of straighforward 'return'.
	   Visualization mode added whereby the simulator tries to fit the
	   advancement of virtual time to real time. Hey, we are beginning to
	   arrive at something decent, aren't we?

R060811A:  Added a virtual destructor to Process to make it possible to have
	   subtype destructors - to clean up when processes are deallocated.
	   Added a new AI: Monitor implementing simple global numerical
	   signals a la PicOS.
	   
R060830B:  Added void delay (double etus, int state) to Timer. This is a
	   shortcut for wait (etuToItu (etus), state).
	   Added a 'touch' to mks to eliminate Cygwin's make complaints about
	   clock skew.
	   Added an XML parser implementing an alternative interface for
	   reading input data (and possibly writing output results).
	   Exception/assert functions redone to accept variable number of
	   arguments, i.e., format + output items.
	   Added parseNumbers to numio.cc.
	   Constants SOL_VACUUM, SOL_COAX, SOL_COPPER, SOL_FIBER
	   MemoryUsed finally eliminated. It was a relic from the days when
	   SMURPH had its own memory allocator.
	   Added setTolerance for Station, getTolerance (global + method)
	   RFPing example working.

 ==============================================================================

R061014A:  First VUEE tree. At this point we discontinue the previous SIDE CVS
	   repository (on sheerness) and start a new one on the Olsonet server.
	   I am archiving the sheerness repository, and the older versions of
	   SIDE will no longer be retrievable directly.

R061021A:  When a process is killed, and its descendants list is nonempty, the
	   descendants are moved to its parent process. Previously, it was
	   illegal to kill a process with a non-empty list of decendants.
	   A new event added to the Process AI: CHILD. This event is triggered
	   whenever a child of the process terminates. Info01 and Info02 are
	   then set to their values in the children, as for DEATH.

	   There are no more zombies, i.e., processes that have been killed
	   while somebody is waiting for them. Wait request that used to be
	   queued at such processes are now moved to a special list.

           Added terminate () as a Station method, which terminates all
	   processes run (owned) by the station. This is intended as a prereq
	   for reset.

	   Added Boolean transmitting () to Port and Transceiver. The method
	   returns YES, if the Port/Transmitter is currently emitting an
	   activity.

	   Note: manual still has to be updated.

R061022A:  Improved deallocation of killed processes. Previously if a process
	   wanted to take advantage of its destructor to deallocate its
	   descendants, the outcome was different depending on whether the
	   process was terminated "normally" (by regular terminate) or by
	   reset (Station::terminate). In the latter case, the non-process
	   descendants were deallocated by the system before the process's
	   desctructor was able to run, which might cause errors. Now, the
	   forced deallocation of descendants takes place after the process
	   subtype desctructor has run, which should be always safe.

R061030A:  Fixed lots of nonsense to make this thing compile (and hopefully
	   run) under Linux, including x86_64. 

R061121A:  Fixed a bug in double IHist::max (double, double) detected by Nick.

R061122A:  Two more bugs found by Nick. Good work!!

R061125A:  Corrections to the manual by Nick.

R061216A:  A transient state declaration is now legal for the first state (and
	   produces the same code as state). Macro 'trace' previously expanded
	   by SMPP is now a function.

R070119A:  Several changes and extensions inspired by VUEE:

	   Mailboxes can now be destroyed (deleted) with processes waiting on
	   them. Such processes are awakened regardless of the event. They can
	   tell that the mailbox has been destroyed by looking at TheMailbox,
	   which is then NULL. This is primarily useful for killing Internet
	   mailboxes and closing their connections in a way that lets everybody
	   perceive their correct status (with a bit of extra effort). While
	   that was also possible previously (with disconnect (CLEAR)), the
	   actual consistent deallocation of mailboxes did pose a bit of
	   problem and was messy.

	   Method outputPending added to (bound) Mailbox.

	   Method resize added to (bound) Mailbox.

	   readToSentinel sets info01 to YES if sentinel found.

	   parseNumbers now reads ints and hexs (TYPE_int, TYPE_hex) + IVal.

	   Operations on pools (doubly-linked lists of related objects) made
	   generally available as pool_in, pool_out. This will not be
	   documented.

	   Operation create pushes TheStation on the stack. Previously
	   create (S) T (...) was confusing as it would reset TheStation as
	   a side effect.

R070217A:  Version 2.90.

	   Documentation and cleanups. Tested on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux
	   systems, as well as (32-bit) Cygwin.

R070325A:  Method queued added to Mailbox. Fixed a deallocation problem for
	   queueing (typed) mailbox.

R070331A:  Multiple include libraries are now possible (change to maker/mks).
	   Models of radio channels and mobility (RWPMM) moved from VUEE/PICOS
	   to Example/IncLib, as they are of more general use.
	   Fixed a bug in radio.c causing corruption of neighborhood lists when
	   transmitter power was increased.
	   Operation trim_pool added. 
	   Fixed a bug in numio.c causing incorrect conversion of HEX numbers
	   by parseNumbers.
	   Simplified syntax of pool_in (type argument removed).
	   Fixed numio (readIn) to accept floating point numbers in the full
	   notation.
	   RFC_xmt added as an honorary assessment method. It determines the
	   amount of time needed to transmit at packet. This way we avoid
	   clumsy and confusing tricks with TLength (packet attributes), which
	   is best left to mean what it is supposed to mean.

R070402B:  Process method getOwner () documented (it was missing from the
           manual). Added operation getproclist. A special sequence (!!), i.e.
	   two consecutive exclamation marks, is detected by SMPP and removed
	   from the source wherever it occurs. This is a way of adding some
	   power to the concatenation mechanism of cpp macros - to allow
	   concatenation of arbitrary token fragments. Quite handy.

R070704A:  Operations 'transmit' and 'sendJam' converted from SMPP macros to
	   regular methods to make it possible to use them from outside of 
	   the process code method.
	   Fixed a small bug in radio.cc: ACTIVITY/SILENCE was not rescheduled
	   after start/end of own transmission.
	   Options added to trace (global function settrace). It is also
	   possible to diable trace from the program (manual updated).
	   DCF module (rfmod_dcf.cc/rfmod_dcf.h) added to Examples/IncLib.

R070718A:  Methods reassess an getPreambleTime added to Transceiver.
	   Those assessment method for which it makes sense can now reference
	   TheTransceiver and ThePacket to get hold of potentially useful
	   "context" information.
	   Template file name option changed to 'M'. Parameters of tracing
	   redone: -t now controls exclusively the "user" trace operation,
	   while -T applies to the state dumping available with -g. Also,
	   settrace expanded to cover the timing parameters. Manual updated
	   accordingly.

R070825A:  Tracing redone again, well, not completely. Now, all -t, -T
	   setting are always applied after the network has been built (which,
	   arguably, removes some of the confusion). Flag 'q'/'s' added at the
	   end of the tracing argument to indicate that simulation should stop
	   at the end of tracing.
	   Operation 'sameas state' added to process code method to work as
	   a goto. In an observer, it behaves exactly as proceed. The handling
	   of proceed in observers has been simplified (retaining all the
	   original semantics).
	   The settrace set completely redone. Multiple stations can now be
	   traced.
	   Fixed a bug in radio.cc: missing one initialization in TRansceiver,
	   which was normally fine as malloc starts from zeroed out storage,
	   but occasionally, with some memory deallocation at initialization,
	   it would cause problems (permanent activity at the transceiver).
	   The version is now 3.0 !!!!!

R070828A:  To do: when station numbers are specified for trace, traces occurring
	   in SYSTEM context are never listed. Is it a bug or a feature? OK,
	   let us ignore this for a while. Note that some callbacks (possibly
	   traced by the user), e.g., channel assessment methods may run in
	   the context of System (station -1). If they are traced, the trace
	   will not show up unless ALL stations are traced.
	   Directional example redone, new example: GreedyDir created in
	   Examples/WIRELESS.
	   Function dist (inline) added to global.h, angles.h added to IncLib.
	
R070830B:  Option -G added to mks. It acts exactly as -g, but the signal
	   handlers for SIGSEGV and so on are disabled. Under Cygwin (at least),
	   this helps to properly catch and diagnose those errors with GDB.
	   A few fixes for time precision > 2 (for some strange reason, a few
	   functions in mparithm caused compilation errors. Not that time
	   precision > 2 is extremely important these days (I don't recall
	   when it was last tested).
	   Fixed a nasty memory allocation bug in nei_xtd (radio.cc) showing
	   up when the xmit power was increased and new nodes were thereby
	   included in the neighborhood.

R070904A:  Ethernet example slightly modfified for the purpose of CMPUT 642.

R070927A:  -G now forces excptn to abort with SIGSEGV - to make sure that all
	   errors (including violations of internal assertions) are caught by
	   gdb (so you can see from there where exactly the problem occured).
	   Packet cleaners added to Link and RFChannel.
	   Macro MONITOR_LOCAL_EVENT added as a tool to declare station-
	   differentiated Monitor events.
	   Method getXTime method added to Transceiver.
	   Global function unwait cancels the wait requests issued so far from
	   the current process.
	   Two new Station methods: getMQBits and getMQSize.
	   Manual updated.

R071001A:  Added a new example (WIRELESS/SimpleRoaming) to be used in a
	   CMPUT642 project. A minor clarification in the manual

R071005A:  Yet another example (WIRELES/Easy) for CMPUT642. Incorporated Nick's
           fix of a cast in mailbox.c, which was frowned upon by gcc 4.1.0 on
	   his MAC.

R071028A:  Added "abstract" as a type qualifier (alternative to "virtual"). An
	   "abstract" type may specify abstract methods and cannot be create'd.
	   Fixed a bug in Examples/IncLib/rfmod_dcf.h: the CP attribute of
	   Xmitter was not initialized.

R071211A:  Method throughput () added to Traffic and Client. It returns ... well
	   ... the current throughput.
	   Fixed a bug in IncLib/rfmod_raw.h.
	   Fixed a (more serious) bug in mailbox.c causing occasional
	   initialization problems when the malloc'ed area for a mailbox was
	   not zeroed out.

R080229A:  Cosmetics needed to eliminate compilation problems with gcc 4.1.2.
	   Apparently "friend" declaration doesn't count as announcement any
	   more.

R080412A:  The type of genSND changed to Long, as it should be.
	   Fixed a minor (-t) confusion in bad_arguments message.
	   Fixed a few memory allocation glitches, mostly harmless, diagnosed
	   by valgrind.
	   Fixed a bug causing references to a deallocated AI (mostly harmless)
	   when the process responsible for triggering a signal or DEATH event
	   was terminated before the event was presented. Now, in such cases,
	   the triggerring AI is assumed to be Kernel.

R080415B:  Fixed a memory leak in radio.cc caused by wrong deallocation of
	   RF_ACTIVITY objects. Any more memory leaks?

R080501A:  Ignored SIGPIPE signals causing occasional problems on UNIX systems.

R080714B:  Reduced SOCKCHKINT to speed up socket (Mailbox) processing under
	   Cygwin (where select doesn't work).
	   When compiled with ZZ_REA or ZZ_RSY (like in VUEE), proceed makes
	   sure that no other events are awaited. This is consistent with PicOS.
	   Assessment methods for RFChannel have been redone. The idea is to
	   extend the role of Tags and make it easier to program tricky things
	   like multiple channels (with nonzero crosstalk) and different
	   transmission rates (with different propagation properties).
	   The type of Tags is now moved to a separate file (rftagtype.h) in
	   SOURCES/KERNEL, so it can be easily changed if desired.
	   SIDE now compiles without warnings with g++ 4.2.3.
	   Version changed to 3.2, manual updated.

R080904A:  Fixed a bug in zz_print_debug_info (process.cc) introduced with
	   R080714B causing compilation errors with -g/-G.
	   
	   Zipf random number generator included (see the manual).

R081110A:  Cosmetics required to appease the new compiler under Linux, which
	   these days complains about ridiculous things.

R090317A:  Fixed a minor bug in process.cc causing compilation errors in with
	   -p.
	   Added examples to Examples/REALTIME illustrating how to drive UARTs
	   asynchronously via mailboxes.

R090517A:  Fixed a bug in Examples/WIRELESS/Easy.

R090601A:  Function parseNumbers improved to recognize and properly handle hex
	   prefixes (0x or 0X) in all integer numbers.

R090809A:  Fixed a minor bug in the RSY mode causing that the wall clock was
	   not set properly on startup.

	   Added the file include capability (a trivial subset of xi:include)
	   to sxml_parse_input in numio.c.

R090825A:  Added a few lines on the iHist (Transceiver) method to the manual
	   (which turned out to be unintentionally undocumented).

R091212A:  Added getTypeId () to Process (needed for the new version of VUEE).
	   The type of first argument to Mailbox->wait changed to IPointer
	   (from Long); this way we can wait on barrier mailboxes for pointers,
	   which will make a difference on 64-bit machines. There is new
	   Process method: nwait returns the number of events the process is
	   waiting for (was needed for VUEE and may be generally useful).

R100123A:  The special name of mks (to select VUEE options) changed to anything
	   starting from "vue". Previously, that name had to be either vuee or
	   vue2 (exactly).

	   Cosmetics in LIB/sxml.c and MONITOR/monpol.cc to shut up the
	   compiler, which becomes more and more obsessive (and annoying) with
	   every new version.

	   Added station methods setLocation and getLocation.

	   The Transceiver variant of startTransfer returns the transceiver
	   pointer in Info2. This is different from the Port variant and may
	   be useful for RFC_xmt.

	   RFC_att simplified by removing the last argument (dst) which is
	   available via TheTransceiver. For RFC_xmt, TheTransceiver points
	   to the sending transceiver.

	   Version bumped to 3.2

R100226A:  Fixed a minor problem in Examples/IncLib/wchan.cc diagnosed by
	   valgrind; not really an error.

	   Fixed a typo in the manual.

R100609A:  Modified mks to allow for (possibly multiple) arguments of the form:
	   '-I path' specifying extra include directories (libraries), in
	   addition to those declared with maker. Also, when mks is invoked as
	   vue..., it checks the environment variable VUEEPATH and, if defined,
	   uses its value as the first extra include library (searched after
	   the ones specified with maker and before those specified with -I).

	   mks/vuee with -Q returns version number + endianness (for picomp)
	   and quits.

	   The vuee part of mks is not documented in the manual, should it be?

R100627A:  Created (test) git repo:
		[remote "unfuddle"]
			url = git@pawel.unfuddle.com:pawel/side.git
			fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/unfuddle/*


R100627B:  Another git test (after clone from the central repo).

R100629A:  Fixed file permissions (using permissions from PICOS/Scripts).

PG100705A:

	   Introduced a new internal type U_Long to be the unsigned counterpart
	   of Long, as with LONG and U_LONG.

PG100706A:

	   RTAGS file introduced, added scripts deploy and cleanup. Read PICOS
	   RTAGS (PG100706A).

PG100719A:

	   Fixed a nasty bug in setXPower causing occasional heap screwups
	   when the transmitter power was reduced.

PG110919A:

	   A semantically irrelevant correction in SOURCES/LIB/sxml.c needed
	   to appease the new version (4.5.3) of gcc. SIDE didn't want to
	   "deploy" after I upgraded my Cygwin setup.

PG111106A:

	   If you use "+" for the output file when invoking the simulator, the
	   output data will go to standard error. This is a more foolproof way
	   to enforce flush on every write than when writing to standard output
	   (at least on Cygwin).

	   This fix is required for PIP.

PG120413A:

	   Added a new execution option, -e, to make it illegal to terminate a
	   process by failing to issue at least one wait request in a state.
	   This is useful for VUEE.

	   In my attempt to revive DSD under Windows 7, I installed a JDK (from
	   Oracle) on my laptop, but when I tried to start the DSD applet, it
	   complained about the inadequate permissions to connect to a local
	   socket. The security/stupidity histeria about Java has forced me to
	   spend two hours figuring out how to connect from a locally executed
	   applet to a localhost socket. For that, you need to modify socket
	   permissions in some obscure file (in my case it was
	   "Program Files/Java/jdk.../jre/lib/security/java.policy). I have
	   added a note in README.txt in the DSD directory, as well as a copy
	   of my java.policy file, in case somebody ever wants to do it again.

PG120605A:	PICOS >= PG120605B, PIP >= PG120605A, VUEE >= PG12060A

	   PICOS deploy now passes the RTAG number (like PG120605A) to maker,
	   which puts it into version.h. When called with -V, mks/vuee prints
	   the version number and exits.

PG120626A:

	   Nick's fix of a couple of typos: Nicholas Boers <boersn@macewan.ca>.

PG120814A:

	   Function sxml_parse_input now accepts an (optional) second argument
	   which can be used to return (and store) the pre-parsed XML data set
	   as a NULL-terminated string with all the includes resolved. This is
	   going to be useful for VUEE: the simulator will be able to save the
	   data set and later convey it to an agent (e.g., udaemon).

PG120917A:	PIP >= PG120917A, VUEE >= PG120917A

	   Fixed the handling of zero resync interval in the RSY mode (the
	   problem was signaled by Nick). Now, with this kind of setting, the
	   model should execute correctly, at full simulation speed, without
	   re-synchronizing itself to real time.

	   It is now possible to pass program call arguments to the model. Any
	   call arguments following -- are made available to the model via:

		int PCArgc;
		const char **PCArgv;

	   in the same way as the standard arguments of main.
	   
PG121113A:

	   A small adjustment to sxml_parse_input which is now a bit safer and
	   more general.
	   
PG130122A:	VUEE >= PG130122A

           A few rather painful modifications constituting a prerequisite for
	   the sample-driven RF channel model. While the modifications were not
	   absolutely necessary, they do help a bit to structure the model and
	   make its components more independent.
	   
	   The primary reason for the pain was the need to introduce similar
	   modifications to the Link-Port interface, for consistency and
	   overall neatness. Then I had to update the document.
	   
	   The essence of the modifications is to provide defaults for some of
	   the essential attributes of Transceivers (and Ports) in RFChannels
	   (and Links). That allows us to set those parameters conveniently in
	   the RFChannel/Link setup method, thus absolving the caller from the
	   need to fix them outside the setup method in a way that would have
	   to assume a specific RFChannel/Link type. Don't worry if you don't
	   get it. I barely get it myself.
	   
	   Version number bumped a bit.

PG130123A:

	   One more change intended to facilitate the new channel model (or
	   rather VUEE in general). Each of the types DISTANCE, RATE, BITCOUNT
	   can now be additionally equivalenced to Long, i.e., a simple int.
	   Especially DISTANCE in VUEE tends to be small enough to fit into
	   Long, which will simplify gridding for the new channel model. The
	   vuee variant of mks now selects the Long option for DISTANCE, which
	   is "-d l". This will also speed up a few things a tiny bit, but you
	   probably won't notice.

PG130211A:	PICOS >= PG130211A, VUEE >= PG130211A

	   A new "sampled" RF channel model added to the library:

	   - wchansd.h and wchansd.cc added to IncLib
	   - cleanups and reorganization of the generic channel model
	   - data library directories (for included XML snippets)
	   - documentation update

PG130214A:	PICOS >= PG130214A, VUEE >= PG130214A

	   For the "sampled" channel model, you can now define sigma on a
	   per-distance basis. This is described in the VUEE doc.

PG130222A:

	   Wlodek discovered that the compiler couldn't find the declaration
	   of function getline on an older version of Cygwin. This should fix
	   it.

PG130319A:

	   Fixed a bug in the sampled channel model which caused incorrect
	   averaging of "perfect hits".

	   The exponential weights have been made scale-invariant by being
	   based on distance ratio to average distance, rather than on absolute
	   distance expressed in DU (as before). This changes the
	   interpretation of the averaging factor (in a nutshell, larger values
	   are now recommended, something of order 1 or bigger).
