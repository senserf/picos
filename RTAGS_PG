PG100628A:

	First for some git-related cleanups:

	1. I propose to use separate RTAG files for the different developers
	   (all two of them ;-). This is RTAGS_PG. I am leaving the original
	   RTAGS file as it was (for the record). I have also created a new
	   file named Version holding the system version to be used by mkmk.

	2. I have modified mkmk (see above), so grab the new version and copy
	   it to your bin. The script fetches the system version from Version
	   and then scans all RTAGS_... selecting the most recent release tag.
	   Tags are expected to contain six digits (according to our tacit
	   standard, e.g., 100628), but may also contain arbitrary other
	   characters, e.g., WO100629A:

	3. We should be using commit messages for meaningful comments. Also, we
	   shouldn't shy away from many small commits (not all of them being
	   necessarily tagged our way), equatting pushes (which should be
	   tagged - the last commit before a push) with previous CVS commits.
	   Note that present commits are lighter weight than old CVS commits.
